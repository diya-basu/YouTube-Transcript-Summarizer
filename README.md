# YouTube-Transcript-Summarizer

YouTube is an American online video-sharing platform headquartered in San Bruno, California, founded by three former PayPal employees—Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim– in February 2005. Google bought the site in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion, since which it operates as one of Google's subsidiaries. 

YouTube allows users to upload videos, view them, rate them with likes and dislikes, share them, add videos to playlists, report, make comments on videos, and subscribe to other users. The slogan "Broadcast Yourself" used for several years and the reference to user profiles as "Channels" signifies the premise upon which the platform is based, of allowing anyone to operate a personal broadcasting station in resemblance to television with the extension of video on demand.

More often than not, users find themselves with a specific and frustrating dilemma. With a variety of content spread out across YouTube’s archives, users might need to learn specific information from a video. And they need to learn it quickly. In that instance: it would be inefficient for the user to sit through an entire video to understand the summary and get answers to a problem statement. Therefore, this project was developed with the aim of providing summaries for any video on YouTube using pre-existing AI and ML based transcripter and summarizer models.

This project, with its back end API developed on Python, and it’s front end coded on Javascript and HTML5, functions as a chrome extension. With the use of CORS unblocker, it is very easy to upload the program files as extensions and use them for processing of data and retrieving summaries of YouTube videos. Alternatively, this can also be deployed as an HTML web page and used to derive the summary of a YouTube video. 

# Working:
To execute the given project: 
Install the following dependencies: 

```
pip install YouTubeTranscriptApi flask transformers
```

# Conclusion: 
This summarizer tool is extremely useful in information processing and synthesising in day-to-day life. It can return the summary of a video within a matter of a few seconds which minimizes user’s own information processing time, and the time saved can be used to analyse the information provided and learn from it. In conclusion the project succeeds in its aim of minimising time consumed to process information, all in all, increasing overall user productivity and efficiency.
